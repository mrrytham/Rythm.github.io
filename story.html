<br><br>


⁤Rythm and Dipsana are good friends. ⁤⁤Rythm is a shy person who always misses the chance to talk with Dipsana because he wants to be someone worthy for Dipsana. ⁤⁤ ⁤⁤Now talking about Dipsana, she is a kind, talented, well-mannered, Science loving girl. ⁤⁤They used to talk to each other on special day only.⁤
<br><br>


⁤One day,  when Rythm and Dipsana were coming back from their class-10 tour, which was organized by the school, they had a conversation while going home. ) <br><br>
            
            
          </p>
            <p><strong>Rythm:</strong> "It was a memorable tour. What is your view about it?"</p>
            <p><strong>Dipsana:</strong> "Yes, it was a really good tour, and I enjoyed it the most when we were heading to Darjeeling."</p>
            <p><strong>Rythm:</strong> "Yes, it was really nice. Do you remember I also bought an earring from there?"</p>
            <p><strong>Dipsana:</strong> "How could I forget it? Because you always walk around me."</p>
            <p><strong>Rythm:</strong> "I don't walk around you. I just..." (Rythm mumbles, then stops)</p>
            <p><strong>Dipsana:</strong> "My friends always tease me with your name. I don't know why they think that about us."</p>
            <p><strong>Rythm:</strong> "Well, I really feel bad for you when they tease you with my name. No one should be attached to me. I'm such a loser."</p>
            <p><strong>Dipsana:</strong> "No, you are not a loser, and I don't feel bothered when my friends tease me with your name."</p>
            <p><strong>Rythm:</strong> "I really feel comfortable around you. You are genuinely someone I could never hate."</p>
            <p><strong>Dipsana:</strong> "Don't try to act innocent. I heard you talking with your friends about your online girlfriend."</p>
            <p><strong>Rythm:</strong> "No! I completely disagree with that. I just told them that I don’t want someone who is temporary."</p>
            <p><strong>Dipsana:</strong> "Do you think I’ll be successful in the future?"</p>
            <p><strong>Rythm:</strong> "I can’t say anything about the future. Even Lord Ram had to go into exile the day before becoming king. But don’t lose hope because I will always pray for your success."</p>
            <p><strong>Dipsana:</strong> "My friends told me about the letter you wrote for me."</p>
            <p><strong>Rythm:</strong> (Rythm became nervous) "Yes, I... it’s in my bag." (he whispered)</p>
            <p><strong>Dipsana:</strong> (She took the letter from his bag and read it for five minutes.)</p>
            <p><strong>Rythm:</strong> "What happened? Why are you silent?"</p>
            <p>(Dipsana did not respond. Rythm looked at Dipsana’s face. It was night, but the moon gave enough light to see her expression. She was crying silently after reading his letter. Rythm felt terrible inside. He didn’t feel guilty, but the pain was different because it was of love. Deep inside, he was telling himself, "Don’t cry, you’re a man.")</p>
            <p><strong>Rythm:</strong> "Dipsana, Dipsana."</p>
            <p><strong>Dipsana:</strong> (She grabbed his hand and said) "I’m really lucky to have you. I’m impressed by your work. You are not a loser. I’ll make sure you are talented before SEE."</p>
            <p><strong>Rythm:</strong> (After 2 minutes) "I will give my best, and I will bring an A grade in SEE."</p>
            <p><strong>Dipsana:</strong> "Bye, Rythm." (Dipsana’s father said, "Let’s get some rest.")</p>
            <p>Rythm: (He was fully nostalgic, thinking about all the effort he had put in since childhood towards her.)</p>
            <p>(Rythm went home without saying anything. He didn’t even talk to his parents that day. When he got home, he went straight to his room and slept with tears in his eyes, thinking about her. But this time, the tears were of dedication, love, a bright future, and happiness.)</p>
            <p>Guess what?</p>
            <p>Rythm brought 3.38, i.e an A in SEE.</p>
