              Darling, if the whole world turns away from you, <br><br>
              I'll remain steadfast with eternal support for you. <br><br><br>

Life is feeling more energetic,  <br><br>
Thinking isn't following the same pattern.  <br><br><br>

The moon is giving a happy smile,  <br><br>
Trees, animals, and family giving another life.  <br><br><br>

The mind is happy with all these things,  <br><br>
But why does the heart want to cry,  
Grabbing tightly to the present?  <br><br><br>

The wind is whispering in my ears, <br><br> 
The mind is enjoying without fear. <br><br><br> 

The words of grandparents feel better,  <br><br>
Without any love or fear for material things.  <br><br><br>

Every eye is giving pure love,  <br><br>
Without envy or jealousy.  <br><br><br>

Those tranquil sounds in the night,<br><br>
With a clear glance at the stars,  <br><br>
Far better than town's pollution, <br><br> 
Crowds, clubs, and bars.  <br><br><br>

Because people get bored of temporary things, but you are my priority for eternity.<br><br><br >

Oh, my queen! Don't try to be innocent by asking me who is my crush. <br><br>
Everything you possess, and everything you have, and all of you are only all and more for me than having crush.<br><br><br>

My Miss, please listen to me and give me one letter.  <br><br>
